## Implementation Notes

### Railway Production Optimization (June 7, 2025)

**Database Monitoring Fix**
- Fixed critical database health check error in `server/monitoring.ts`
- Issue: `db.execute is not a function` in production
- Solution: Updated to use `database.db.execute()` from `getDatabase()` result
- Status: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Health endpoint now returns healthy status

**Client-Side Production Configuration**
- Fixed hardcoded localhost:5001 in `client/src/components/settings-menu.tsx`
- Updated to use production URL when NODE_ENV=production
- Ensures webhook URLs display correct Railway domain in settings
- Status: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

**Replit Legacy Cleanup**
- Removed Replit development banner from `client/index.html`
- Fixed viewport meta tag accessibility issue (removed maximum-scale)
- Cleaned up development-specific scripts for production deployment
- Status: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

**Environment Variable Configuration**
- Updated n8n webhook URLs to use `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable
- Provides production flexibility for webhook endpoint configuration
- Maintains backward compatibility with hardcoded fallback
- Status: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### CSV Prospect Upload Fix (June 7, 2025)

**Issue Identified**
- CSV uploads were not creating prospects in the database
- Prospects were not being sent to n8n webhook for AI research
- `processCsvProspects` was just a stub function that only marked uploads as complete

**Solution Implemented**
- Implemented full CSV processing logic in `processCsvProspects` function
- Added batch processing with configurable batch size
- Each CSV record is mapped to prospect fields and validated
- Prospects are created in the database with proper client workspace isolation
- After each batch, prospects are sent to n8n webhook for research
- Progress tracking updates CSV upload status in real-time
- Error handling for invalid records with detailed logging

### n8n Webhook Payload Format Fix (June 7, 2025)

**Issue Identified**
- Prospects were being sent to n8n but the webhook wasn't processing them correctly
- The payload format didn't match what n8n expected
- n8n workflow expects an array of objects with specific field names

**Solution Implemented**
- Updated `processBatchResearch` function to format payload correctly for n8n
- Changed to array format as n8n expects body to be an array
- Use exact field names with spaces:
  - `firstName` ‚Üí `First Name`
  - `lastName` ‚Üí `Last Name`
  - `linkedinUrl` ‚Üí `LinkedIn`
  - `title` ‚Üí `Title`
  - `company` ‚Üí `Company`
  - `email` ‚Üí `EMail`

### ‚úÖ n8n API Integration for Real-Time Monitoring (June 8, 2025)

**Complete n8n API Integration Implemented**
- **Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard**: Full dashboard for tracking n8n workflow executions
- **API Endpoints**: Comprehensive REST API for n8n integration
  - `/api/prospects/monitoring/status` - Get current prospect processing status
  - `/api/n8n/executions` - List executions with filtering
  - `/api/n8n/executions/:id` - Get specific execution details
  - `/api/n8n/executions/current` - Get active executions
  - `/api/n8n/workflows` - List available workflows
  - `/api/n8n/analytics` - Performance metrics and insights
  - `/api/n8n/executions/:id/debug` - Debug information for troubleshooting

**Database Schema Updates**
- Added `n8nExecutionId`, `n8nStartedAt`, `n8nCompletedAt` fields to prospects table
- Proper indexing for fast execution queries
- Migration script created for production deployment

**React Components**
- **N8nMonitoring Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring interface with tabs

- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error display and logging

**n8n API Client**
- Full integration with n8n Cloud API
- Authentication with API key
- Error handling and retry logic
- Rate limiting compliance
- Debug information extraction

**Environment Configuration**
- `N8N_API_BASE_URL`: n8n instance URL
- `N8N_API_KEY`: API authentication key
- Environment template updated for production setup

**Benefits for Debugging**
- **Real-Time Visibility**: See exactly what's happening with n8n workflows
- **Execution Tracking**: Link prospects to specific n8n executions
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor success rates and execution times
- **Error Analysis**: Identify failure patterns and bottlenecks
- **Debug Tools**: Comprehensive information for troubleshooting webhook issues

### üî¥ n8n Production Integration Issue (June 8, 2025)

**Critical Issue Discovered**
- Complete workflow was working perfectly on localhost:5001
- After Railway deployment, n8n webhook connection stopped working
- Prospects are created but not sent for AI research
- No research results being received back
- This breaks the entire application workflow

**Enhanced Debugging Capabilities**
- **n8n Monitoring Dashboard**: Now available to track executions in real-time
- **API Integration**: Direct access to n8n for status monitoring
- **Execution Tracking**: Can see if webhooks are reaching n8n
- **Performance Analytics**: Identify bottlenecks and failure patterns

**Potential Root Causes**
1. n8n webhook configured for localhost:5001, not accepting Railway URL
2. CORS or network restrictions in Railway environment
3. Environment variable configuration issues
4. Webhook URL not properly updated in n8n workflow

**Next Steps with Enhanced Monitoring**
1. Use n8n monitoring dashboard to check if executions are created
2. Monitor webhook connectivity in real-time
3. Analyze execution failure patterns through analytics
4. Use debug endpoints to identify specific failure points
5. Verify n8n workflow configuration accepts Railway URL
