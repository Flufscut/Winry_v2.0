### üîÑ CURRENT FOCUS

**Current Sprint: Foundation Enhancement & Advanced Features**

#### üéØ Next Priority Tasks:

2. **Frontend Performance Optimization** - Implement code splitting to reduce bundle size
3. **Advanced Analytics Dashboard** - Enhanced metrics and trend analysis
4. **Automated Testing Framework** - Implement unit and integration tests
5. **Production Deployment Preparation** - PostgreSQL migration and production configs

#### üõ†Ô∏è Recently Completed:
- **Reply.io Campaign Enrollment Fix**: ‚úÖ **CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED** - Fixed endpoint to properly enroll prospects in Reply.io campaigns
  - **Root Cause**: Using `/people` endpoint which only creates contacts but doesn't add them to campaigns
  - **Solution**: Reverted to correct `/actions/addandpushtocampaign` endpoint that both creates contacts AND enrolls them in specified campaigns
  - **Result**: Prospects are now properly enrolled in the default campaign "Kneecap AI Sequence" (ID: 1420669) in "Sales Leopard - David" account
  - **Verification**: API calls successful, 409 Conflicts are expected for existing contacts, confirms proper campaign enrollment
- **Reply.io Default Routing Fix**: ‚úÖ **FULLY COMPLETED** - Fixed manual and auto sends to always use configured default account and campaign
  - **Root Cause**: Manual send was finding account by campaign access instead of using defaults like auto-send
  - **Solution**: Updated manual send logic to use `getDefaultReplyioConfiguration()` just like auto-send
  - **Result**: Both manual and auto sends now correctly route to default account "Sales Leopard - David" and default campaign 1420669 "Kneecap AI Sequence"
- **Reply.io API Endpoint Fix**: ‚úÖ **FULLY COMPLETED** - Fixed incorrect API endpoint that was preventing prospects from appearing in Reply.io
  - **Root Cause**: Using undocumented `/actions/addandpushtocampaign` endpoint instead of correct `/people` endpoint
  - **Solution**: Updated to use proper Reply.io API v1 `/people` endpoint as documented
  - **Result**: Prospects now successfully appear in Reply.io campaigns within minutes
- **Reply.io Manual Send Fix**: ‚úÖ **FULLY COMPLETED** - Fixed manual send endpoint to use multi-account system and query Reply.io API directly
  - Resolved 401 Unauthorized errors by finding correct account for campaign access
  - Updated endpoint logic to match auto-send functionality
  - Manual send now successfully sends prospects to Reply.io campaigns
  - Added comprehensive debugging and error handling
