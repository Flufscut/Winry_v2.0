# 🔧 n8n Webhook Configuration Fix

## ❌ Current Issue:
Your n8n workflow "Kneecap 4.0 - MirrorMate" (ID: Jd4V75hcZrsHfu7O) is configured to send results to:
```
http://localhost:5001/webhook/n8n-results
```

## ✅ Required Fix:
Update the n8n HTTP Request node to send results to:
```
https://winrybysl-production.up.railway.app/webhook/n8n-results
```

## 📋 Steps to Fix:

1. **Login to n8n**: Go to https://salesleopard.app.n8n.cloud/
2. **Open Workflow**: Find "Kneecap 4.0 - MirrorMate" workflow
3. **Find HTTP Request Node**: Look for the node that sends results back
4. **Update URL**: Change from `localhost:5001` to `winrybysl-production.up.railway.app`
5. **Save & Activate**: Save the workflow and ensure it's active

## 🔄 Alternative Webhook URL (if needed):
```
https://winrybysl-production.up.railway.app/api/webhook/n8n-data
```

## ✅ Verification:
After making this change:
1. Upload a new test prospect
2. Check the prospect status - it should change from "processing" → "completed"
3. The prospect should have research results populated

## 🎯 Result:
Once fixed, the complete end-to-end workflow will be:
1. ✅ CSV Upload → Prospect Creation
2. ✅ Prospect → n8n Webhook (WORKING)
3. ✅ n8n Research Processing (WORKING) 
4. ✅ Results → Production Webhook (WILL WORK)
5. ✅ Status Update → "completed" (WILL WORK)
